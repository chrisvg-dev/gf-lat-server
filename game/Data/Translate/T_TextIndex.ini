17406|<Exotic Explorer> Huijia: "As for the one on top, it contains all kinds of souvenirs I bought in Deepfathom. They are things I've never seen in Saphael! I didn't expect there to be such beautiful scenery and special people and things in another world!"|
17405|<Exotic Explorer> Huijia: "The box above them contains manifold magic bottles from Ilya, the most famous City of Magic in Saphael. They did surprise me the first time I saw them! Since they are fragile, please be careful!"|
17404|<Exotic Explorer> Huijia: "The two boxes above contain all kinds of exquisite accessories. They were brought back by the Four Seas Trade Council in Prism Island Prairie from distant foreign lands! I'm sure people will like these exotic accessories!"|
17403|<Exotic Explorer> Huijia: "Walking is boring. Let me introduce the souvenirs on your back! The Sprite Fruit in the bottom box come from the Gaia Woodlands. They grow very well with the protection of the Eternal Mother. I've tried one myself, and it's super sweet and juicy!"|

13393|"Battlefield Background"
On the eve of the Day of Destiny, Sprites in Saphael discovered a desolate Sprite world in a dimensional fissure.
Within this alternate universe is a ruined altar
shrouded in a mysterious nature-healing power. Sprites believe
this aura is linked to the miracle power of the parallel world; perhaps it offers salvation for Saphael.
.
However, two sides are locked in a feud over whether or not to trigger the altar's remaining powers.
Both sides have now promised great rewards to
any Sprite Messengers that can retrieve the powers.
This causes an unexpected battle to break out among Sprite Messengers from around the world.
and a massive battle ensues.
"Rules"
(1) Players are divided into Blue and Red Teams and must attack the three crystals on the field.
¡@¡@¡@When a crystal turns into the color of one side, that side will receive 1 point every 8 sec.
(2) Both sides can use the teleporter next to the South Village and North Village Crystal
¡@¡@¡@to teleport directly to the center of the battlefield and fight for control over the central crystal.
(3) The main forces are located in the northwest and southeast.
¡@¡@¡@Defeat the enemy leader in that area, and friendly reinforcements will pour forth to help
            attack the enemy crystals.
(4) 1 Point is awarded for every player defeated.
(5) The side that defeats 100 enemy soldiers will receive powerful reinforcements.
            Every soldier killed has the chance to grant the
            PvP Kill Reward buff to the player's character.
(6) The first side to reach 250 Points or the side
¡@¡@¡@with a higher score after 20 minutes, wins. At the end of the battle, the system will award scores based on performance,
¡@¡@¡@and the player with the highest score on the
¡@¡@¡@winning side will be crowned the Battlefield MVP.
(7) Players will need the points obtained on the battlefield to collect the Sprite Kings' secret treasures.
¡@¡@¡@Get ready for the fight of your life!|

8583|Ever since the dawn of time, the world has been held in balance by the power of the sprites. It is said that in the earliest days, before the people of Saphael had split into competing tribes and factions, humans could interact with these mystical creatures. In those times, humans lived in a state of harmony with Nature, and sprites were plentiful throughout the land.

Unfortunately, this age of tranquility would not last. As the tribes of Saphael continued to splinter and sever ties, their natural bond with the sprites also began to fade. They eventually spread to all corners of the world and built settlements -- razing forests, clearing fields, and tearing down mountains to erect their majestic cities.

Driven by an insatiable desire for power over their human brethren, some of these factions ventured deep into the earth where they unlocked dark and ancient secrets that would ultimately threaten to destroy all of mankind. Perhaps chief among these dangers were the great demon lords and dragons that terrorized the people of Saphael and set their villages and cities ablaze.

All would have been lost if it were not for the emergence of the Sprite Messengers. These rare and remarkable people had managed to preserve their link with the sprites while the rest of humanity had moved on. The sprites granted these individuals magical powers to combat the evil and help restore balance to the world. The whole of Saphael would unite behind these legendary few and together, they would beat back the forces of darkness that had once threatened to overwhelm them.

The peace was short-lived. The various factions that had united under the leadership of the Sprite Messengers soon returned to their ways and went to war with each other. Worse, even the Messengers came to be affected. Although they had previously seemed above such petty divisions, many of them took sides in the conflict while only a handful remained to try and ease hostilities. The period that ensued would come to be known as the "Great Saphael War."

The war lasted several generations and was far worse than anything Saphael had ever seen. Countless innocents were killed, families were torn apart, villages were razed, cities were destroyed, and powers constantly shifted. The world descended into a long age of darkness.

During this time, a reclusive group of Sprite Messengers fled to a tiny island off the southern coast of the mainland. They settled the uninhabited island and came to call it Siwa, after a great hero from the time before the War. These few remaining Sprite Messengers renewed and strengthened their union with Nature in the hope that one day the power of the sprites would be great enough to restore balance and save Saphael from its calamitous fate.

The flames of the Great War would eventually abate and gradually, the people of Saphael would begin to recover. This tenuous calm, however, has been threatened once again by a great evil that has awoken from deep within the earth -- a kind unseen since the Age of the Ancients.

Although Saphael is now a shell of its former self, a beacon of hope shines brightly from the shores of Siwa Island. The descendents of the final Sprite Messengers are coming of age and are almost ready to leave their island home. Will they follow in the footsteps of their ancestors and strive for balance, or will they succumb to Saphael's divisions and turn against each other? This is where your story begins.|
8584|Sprites are mystical creatures that are rumored to have existed since the beginning of time. They remain unseen to most people, choosing to reveal themselves only to a select few. They are inextricably linked to Nature and it is their power that holds the world in balance. When this balance is threatened, Sprites seek out and grant their powers to Sprite Messengers.|
8585|Each player is the descendent of Sprite Messengers, born to choose a guardian Sprite to accompany them through their lives. Sprite Messengers of Siwa Island must face the trials when they come of age, and if they pass the trials, they will begin their journey of rescuing Sprites on the Saphael mainland.

For a Sprite Messenger, one should not only train oneself in games, but also cultivates Sprites as the most important mission, let sprites return to the nature once they grow up, and resuce Saphael from being devastation.

In addition to their own Guadian Sprites, the players will encounter more sprites in their adventure. It's your task to cultivate these naughty and adorable sprites and take them back to nature...|

 the cities, provided they have the necessary talent blueprints or resonance 
 stone formulas.

 will add a lighting effect to one-handed weapons, while inlaying 4 resonance stones of the 
 same type will add this effect to a 2-handed weapon.
 

When attacking with weapons or offensive magic, or for specific targets, all 
 resonance stones inlaid in your equipment will resonate and increase the power of your attacks.

by monsters during fights, or at Sprite Altars after having acquired 
a certain level of reputation. 

*Sprite Skills 
Every Sprite possesses different collection and equipment manufacturing 
skills. 
With good training, the items they collect or manufacture will 
improve, which can be quite beneficial for you! 

*Mood: 
A Sprite's mood changes depending upon player interactions. More good 
things happen when Sprites are happy. If a Sprite's mood falls very low, the 
Sprite you have worked so hard to train may just disappear or run away.
 

*Sprite Cottage 
As a good Sprite Messenger, you naturally must pay attention to your Sprites' 
living environment.
 You may acquire a variety of different Sprite furniture with 
which to decorate the Sprite cottage. Not only will the furniture make the 
cottage more homey, some of it actually has tangible benefits. 

*Sprite Upgrade 
Sprites acquired in the game remain at the same level throughout. Only the 
Guardian Sprite acquired at the very beginning can achieve higher levels as 
its abilities increase. 

When a player meets requirements for higher levels, upgrade missions are 
automatically initiated (at Levels 21, 51, and 71). After completion of the Sprite 
level-up mission, the Guardian Sprite can make a breakthrough in training and 
acquire better abilities.|

On the eve of Day of Destiny, Sprites in Saphael discover a desolate Sprite world in a dimensional fissure.
 There is a ruined altar shrouding in a mysterious nature-healing power. Sprites believe that the altar is a
 new hope for saving Saphael. 

The Sprite King has promised great rewards to Sprite Messengers who can bring the crystal's energies back.
 This causes an unexpected battle to break out among Sprite Messengers from around the world over the
 dream land. 

Rules: 
  (1) Players are divided into Blue and Red to attack the five crystals on the field. When a crystal turns into
         the color of one side for a certain length of time, points will be awarded to that side. 
  (2) Once the Blue and Red side break the totems near the Mine Crystal, Central Crystal and Forest Crystal,
         portals leading to the three crystals will open near the North Village Crystal and South Village Crystal 
         next to the Rebirth Point. 
  (3) A crystal will turn yellow after awarding ownership points and start to countdown. When the countdown
         ends, the crystal releases its energy as a massive explosion. Players are advise to stay away. After the
         explosion, the crystal can be captured again. 
  (4) 1 point is awarded for every player defeated, 20 points for taking over the Central Crystal and 10 points
         for taking over the other crystals. 
  (5) The first side reaching 250 points or the side with a higher score after 20 minutes wins. 
  (6) At the end, the system will award battle scores based on performance. The player with the highest score
        on the winning side will be the Battlefield MVP. 
  (7) Players will need the points obtained on battlefield to collect the Sprite King's secret treasures.

On the eve of the Day of Destiny, sprites in Saphael found a new crystal in the mouth of a volcano called 
Hell of Fire in Blakatoa Range. Sprite Messengers have been asked to help protect the crystal before the
 monsters can get to it. 

The Sprite King has promised great rewards to Sprite Messengers who can bring the crystal's energies
 back. This causes an unexpected battle to break out among Sprite Messengers from around the world
 over the New Life Crystal. 

Rules: 
  (1) Players are divided into Blue and Red to attack New Life Crystal on the field. When the crystal turns
         into the color of one side, that side will receive 1 point every 3 sec. 
  (2) The owner must defend the crystal while the other side must try to capture it. The attacking and
         defending side switch when the color of the crystal changes after being attacked. 
  (3) 1 point is awarded for every player defeated. 
  (4) When the score difference reaches 35, the system will randomly pick up a player from the losing side
        and transform the player into a Flying Dragon. Each side can only transform once per battle. 
  (5) The first side reaching 250 points or the side with a higher score after 20 minutes wins. 
  (6) At the end, the system will award battle scores based on performance. The player with the highest
        score on the winning side will be the Battlefield MVP. 
  (7) Players will need the points obtained on battlefield to collect the Sprite King's secret treasures.

11081|Battlefield Background
 
On the eve of the Day of Destiny, the Kaslow Army came across a deserted island in the south sea.
 On the island is a strange Forest Crystal that seems to harbor great power. The Kaslow Army plans
 to host practice battles using the power of the Forest Crystal as a way to boost the strength of the
 Sprite Messengers.Therefore, troops have been stationed on the island for Sprite Messengers to
 challenge. 

The Kaslow Army encouraged Sprite Messengers to take the power of Forest Crystal with them. 
 Sprite Messengers who acquired the power will receive a rich reward. This causes an unexpected
 battle to break out among Sprite Messengers from around the world over the power of the
 Forest Crystal. 

Rules
  (1) Players are divided into Blue and Red camps. Each camp begins with 300 points. First side to be
        reduced to 0 points loses. 
  (2) Players can attack and capture the Forest Crystal on the battlefield. When the crystal changes to
        your side's color, 3 points are deducted from the enemy side every 10 sec for the first 15 min. 
        8 points are deducted every 10 sec in the last 5 minutes. 
  (3) The owner must defend the crystal while the other side must try to capture it. The attacking and
        defending side switch when the color of the crystal changes after being attacked. 
  (4) 1 point is awarded for every player defeated. 
  (5) The side with a higher score after 20 minutes wins. The battle will also end earlier if one side is
        reduced to 0 points. 
  (6) At the end, the system will award battle scores based on performance. The player with the
        highest score on the winning side will be the Battlefield MVP. 
  (7) Players will need the points obtained on battlefield to collect the Sprite King's secret treasures.
        Do your best!|

11230|Battlefield Background

The Sprite Bodok has been traveling everywhere to battle the reawakening 
dark powers. He became lost one day and found an ancient labyrinth that 
hummed with an ancient power.

The maze hides a strong power, but there are many traps to catch brash 
adventurers unaware. Babama, however, thinks it will make an excellent
training ground for practicing the skills necessary to fight against the dark
powers.

Rules: 
  (1) Players have 5 minutes of preparation time once they sign up. During
          this time, they may move freely through the maze, but may not attack
          or be attacked.
 
  (2) In the interest of fairness, player names will be hidden and players will
         all look the same.

  (3) The battlefield will run for 25 minutes. Those who survive until the end
         will be the winners. 

  (4) Each player will receive EXP or Mastery EXP depending on how long
         they last. The ultimate winner will receive 150% EXP or Mastery EXP,
         while the remaining players will receive 50% EXP or Mastery EXP. 

  (5) Players will receive the "Ancient Curse" every 5 minutes. It can only be
         removed by killing another player. 

  (6) "Annihilating Thunder" will appear every 5 minutes. All players in the 
          location with the "Ancient Curse" will be struck dead by the lightning. 

  (7) Players that kill a player more than 10 levels below their level will
         receive the "Butchering Curse" that makes them more vulnerable to
         other players. 

  (8) The location also contains other traps for the players to discover on
         their own. It's up to you to see what you're made of!|

11583|Carso, the self-titled Hero of Time, built an altar in Deepfathom. Though his power is growing, the other eleven Sprite Kings refused to accept him. Angered by the slight, Carso decided to open the alternate dimension where "Quills" is imprisoned in a bid to take his power and prove his strength. 

     With his youth as a weapon, Carso gradually chips away the seal imprisoning Quills and uses power as a bait to lure the top Sprite Messengers in Saphael to the Seal Dimension. If they agree to become his disciple of protecting Seal Dimension, Carso will grant them a part of his power over Saphael. The other Sprite Kings are furious at Carso and begin to awake from the long sleep. 

     The battle for the Seal Dimension is not just a struggle between the Sprite Kings but a battle for the supreme control over the world.|

11705|Battlefield Background
 
To prepare Sprite Messengers for the coming Day of Destiny, the Sprite Kings have used their
 magic to create a fight club in which Sprite Messengers can fight each other without causing 
 any lasting harm. 

The Sprite Kings also hope that this exercise will help build friendships and rapport between
 Sprite Messengers and their companions. Sprite Messengers with more companions will
 therefore earn more battlefield points in this free-wheeling arena.
 
Rules: 
  (1) Players over LV 31 can enter the Sprite Kings' Fight Club at any time. Battlefield reputation
         is granted directly for killing up to 100 unique players in one day. No further battlefield
         reputation will be granted after killing 100 unique players that day. The number of kills
         will be refreshed at the end of the day. 
  (2) Killing players 10 levels lower than yourself don't grant any battlefield reputation, but the
         kill will count towards the 100 unique player limit. 
  (3) No points will be awarded once you have killed 100 unique players that day, including
        those that give reputation points and lower-level players that don't grant any. Players must
        therefore choose their targets carefully to maximize their score. 
  (4) Being in a party doubles the battlefield reputation earned from kills. Players are
        encouraged to form parties and make friends during these mock battles. 
  (5) Can't leave battlefield during combat.|

12156|[Battlefield Background] 
The Kaslow Guard came across a magnificent and ornate temple building while exploring Deepfathom. The investigators believe that this is the Hall of Judgment, built by ancient sprite kings to test their mettle. 
Sprite Messengers across Saphael believe that the Hall of Judgment is the perfect place to prove themselves. All the different factions have now gathered to fight over the title of "Duel Master!" 

[Rules] 
(1) Registration is based on random matchmaking. Players will be pitted only against other players in their own level range. The level ranges are: LV 31 - 40, LV 41 - 50, and so on. 
(2) The players will be divided into Red and Blue camps. Once the waiting period ends, players will be teleported at random to the East, South, West, and North gates of the arena. 
(3) The NPC inside the rest area can be used to adjust the amount of HP. Lower HP gives more class reputation at the end of the match. For example, 40% HP gives 60% bonus to the final score. The bonus only applies if the match is won. 
(4) Once inside the arena, the duel will last for 120 sec. Defeat the opponent within the time limit to win. The loser will return to the rest area, while the winner stays in the arena. If there is no winner after 120 sec, both sides are teleported back to the rest area. 
(5) The Hall of Judgment requires 3 wins out of 5. A win, draw, or loss will all affect reputation. The first player to win 3 matches is declared the victor. 
(6) Winning 3 matches in a row gives bonus class reputation, so do all you can to wipe out your opponent swiftly! 
(7) There are various types of energy and crystals inside the arena. Use them wisely if you wish to claim victory. 
(8) Diana and Nadai will give you special encouragement if you return to the rest area after a draw or loss. 
(9) The reputation earned on the battlefield can be used to win the King of Duels honor, so do your best!|

¡@¡@and outfits require 3 pieces, while two-handed weapons require 6

¡@¡@requires fewer crafting ingredients and
¡@¡@will possess better attributes after the upgrade.
G. Once the best quality has been achieved,

12353|Guide to the Equipment Growth System 
*Equipment Growth:
Take the item to the master, place it in the item improvement 
slot, and equip it on your character.
When the player earns experience, some of the 
experience will go towards the weapon. 

*Weapon Improvement Direction:
All equipment types have five directions to choose from. The player must choose two directions for 
equipment growth. The player can select the attributes
they want to improve. When a piece of growing 
equipment receives enough experience to level up,
a random attribute will be improved. Once the Weapon Improvement Direction has been set,
it cannot be changed. 

*Notes:
Equipment mastery level may not exceed the character level. 
The equipment must be equipped to improve equipment mastery. 
Once the equipment has reached its maximum level, it may not gain any 
more growth experience. 

*(STR) Strength: Improves Strength 
*(VIT) Vitality: Improves Vitality 
*(INT) Intelligence: Improves Intelligence 
*(WIL) Will: Improves Will 
*(AGI) Agility: Improves Agility 
*(HP) Health: Improves Health 
*(MP) Energy: Increases Energy 
*(ATK) Attack: Increases Melee Attack Power 
*(R-ATK) Ranged Attack: Increases Ranged Attack Power 
*(M-ATK) Magic Attack: Increases Magic Attack Power 
*(DEF) Defense: Increases Physical Defense 
*(M-DEF) Magic Defense: Increases Magic Defense 
*(P-CRIT) Physical Critical Hit: Improves the chance of landing physical critical hits

The rings contain the blessings and magical power of many Sprite Kings. Their glittering radiance will illuminate your journey. 

May you stay together through thick and thin and live happily ever after.|
12512|With the Sprite King as your witness, have the two of you decided to join your spirits for all time?|
12513|The <Blazing Giant> Hartmore appeared in Jale to steal Bubbly Water! Defeat him as quickly as possible! Do it for the people of Jale!|
12514|Love is also about tolerance and forgiveness. Do you really want to break your marital vows with your other half?|
12515|After the divorce, the wedding ring will be taken. All love coins will be removed, as well. Do you wish to continue?|
12516|You seem to still care about her somewhere in your heart! Think it over before you make a rash decision!|

12521|"Intruders! You shall feel the wrath of the Chiyu Totem!" 
When you heard the voice of the Chiyu Chieftain echoing from up ahead, your body seemed to become heavier.|
12522|"My powers - they are weakening!" 
The Totem of Seven Souls has been destroyed. The Chieftain lost the Curse of Seven Souls effect.|
12523|"Infidels! I will make you pay for this!!" 
The Totem of Six Spirits has been destroyed. The Chieftain lost the Curse of Six Spirits effect.|
12524|The Gathering Assistants congregate at the back of the hall. Please protect them; they are very vulnerable.|
12525|Who dares to disturb the peace of the temple? Prepare to feel my wrath! roared a furious voice. The Wildfire Lion has arrived!|
12526|Master... I have failed you. Please forgive me... the Wildfire Lion whimpered as it collapsed.|
12527|What is that wonderful smell? Medium-rare, juicy beef... sharp cheddar cheese... and... is that bacon? Myron practically choked on his own drool, lured into the open by the irresistable scent of a Premium Beef Hamburger!|
12528|Noooo!! I didn't get to eat the hamburger! I've been dreaming of that burger my entire life. Maybe just shove it in my mouth now - you're going to have to chew for me, Myron managed just before he slumped over.|
12529|That smell is so familiar. It's been so long since I tasted venison. Femur licked his chops, lured into the open by the smell of succulent Premium Deer Steak.|
12530|How did these mere insects defeat me!? Femur exclaimed, furious, as his bones gradually turned to dust.|
12531|"Mmm. Smells like someone got takeout at Red Lobster. Did you bring me any of those cheesy biscuits?" mused  
Agrat, lured into the open by the smell of Premium Fish Soup.|
12532|It's not over yet! I'll be back! Suddenly, a brilliant beam of light shot out of Agrat's broken body.|

The Kaslow Emperor Resistance is assembled from the former Royal Praetorian Guard of Kaslow King Odin. 

After Kaslow fell to the Beastman Army, the once largest city in the world was consumed by fire, and King Odin mysteriously disappeared. 

To reclaim Kaslow and restore its former glory, Posolain, the Royal Duke of Kaslow, and Jarl, the Royal Praetorian Guard Leader, joined forces to assemble the Kaslow Emperor Resistance. 

The two appear to be working together peacefully in an effort to incite rebellions against the Beastman Army throughout the kingdom. However, rumors suggest political controversies behind the scenes. 

The Rebel Base is divided into two forces: 

the Royalists supporting King Odin and led by Posolain the Royal Duke of Kaslow, and the Radicals fighting against the Beastmen and led by Jarl the Royal Praetorian Guard Leader. 

The war in Kaslow has crept into the hearts and souls of those in the Rebel Base.|

The Ilya Vengeance Cult is a secret organization shrouded in darkness and magic in Ilya. 

If the Ilya Elder Council is the force of light, then the Ilya Vengeance Cult, which secretly upholds justice and punishes evil, is the force of darkness. 

The twin forces of light and dark governed the life in Ilya until the Wisewood Army invaded. 

Even before the Wisewood invasion, Ilya was a strangely quiet place. A softly flowing river wound through the heart of the city, and all buildings, big and small, were covered in vines and weeds. Large plants jutted up through cracks in concrete, occasionally spewing noxious purple gas and spores into the air. 

The members of the organization believed that the Ilya Elder Council and the White Flame Order were outdated and too conservative. Thus, to make a change, the Ilya Vengeance Cult stepped out of the shadows and into the light. 

The radical General Ifu was charged with taking on the Wisewood forces. 

The struggles between light and dark, yin and yang, are like the vines crawling over the city walls, slowing edging toward the abyss of eternal damnation...|

Members of the Jale Steam Machine Mercenaries, a freedom organization, are the elites of the mechanical city of Jale. 

These mercenaries fight relentlessly for freedom at any cost. 

Clauza, head of the Mercenaries, is a courageous and brilliant leader. He is careful, ruthless, and highly respected among the Mercenaries. 

After millions of bugs invaded Jale and covered the town in thick, milky webs, he began working to unite the three forces to save Jale. 

The bugs' sticky webs and secretions have rendered much of Jale's prized machinery useless. The city has been cleared of all signs of civilization. 

The fight to gain more support and turn the tide against the writhing bugs is about the begin...|

On the eve of the Day of Destiny,
a dark conspiracy enveloped Saphael. The three forces - Beastmen, Wisewoods, and Bugs -
revolted in the absence of King Odin and took over Kaslow. 
Colonel Clark of the Kaslow Royal Guard is charged with seeking help from Sprite Messengers,
hoping to reclaim the city and reinstate peace
before King Odin reappears.
Although the fight against the three leaders promises to be extremely dangerous,
the Sprite Messengers who successfully defeat them will be rewarded with rare, valuable materials.
The fight to protect the city begins now.

12906|<Mercenary Leader> Clauza emerges from the shadows next to Gibelle.|
12907|A great many evil phantoms have appeared out of nowhere. A strong killing aura follows in their path. In order to destroy the crystal holding the phantom's magic, an elf envoy with a low-pressure spirit must defeat the evil skeleton on the upper level and claim the spirit of the skeleton!|
12908|The first crystal of the phantom's magic breaks from the invasion of the skeleton's spirit. All the evil phantoms nearby a sudden drop in their energy. If you can break the second crystal, you can destroy these horrible phantoms!|
12909|"Who dreams of expelling us from the Phantom Ship?! I will smash your body and swallow your soul!" A furious howl echoes throughout the ship. Just hearing its voice sends shivers down your spine.|
12910|A lot of evil skeletons have suddenly appeared in the originally empty cabin! They look to merely be a group of phantoms, find the source behind these phantoms and defeat it!|
12911|"Don't be so smug¡K I will come back again¡K" Painful screams from the evil skeletons fade into the air.|
12912|"You should be able to find an iron box holding a special power in the 8 cabins on the upper level. Find it!" Kuda's voice echoes from the below.|
12913|With the phantom void now gone the cabin is gradually being filled with countless phantom jelly rabbits, there seems to be no end to them! But wait, they seem to contain objects in the shape of keys in their bodies..?|
12914|A gigantic phantom walker dangles around the cabin. It's going to take a special power to defeat him, go and find a way to deal with him with Kuda!|
12915|Under the power of the purifying force, the phantom walker disappears as it becomes completely purified.|
12916|"Heh heh¡K What are these strange things doing here? It's such a mystery. A mysterious voice resonates in the cabin, causing your blood to freeze with a laugh that seems to mock life itself.  |
12917|"Hateful invaders. Return the Phantom Energy Core¡K" Phantom skeletons appear throughout the cabin to block your way! Cross them quickly and head for the bottom!|
12918|"Don't go¡K" the remaining voices of the phantom skeletons clatter within the cabin. The eerie sound sets your hairs on end.|
12919|With a towering boom the phantom walker falls over, fading into a noxious smell. But even now you can still feel there are a lot of spirits filled with bad intentions lurking in the darkness. |
12920|"It's the confused evil skeleton!" Find its confused missing body, answer the evil skeleton's questions, and gain the power to defeat it!"   Kuda screams anxiously.|
12921|"Heh Heh Heh! You impudent creatures, do you really think you have the wisdom to solve my puzzles?"  The confused evil skeleton laughs maliciously.|
12922|"Heh heh heh! This time I won't be so easy on you with my questions. Time to wake up!" The confused evil skeleton laughs maliciously.|
12923|"Heh heh heh¡K I hear that you have 12 Elf Kings now, yes?" The confused evil skeleton asks between bouts of laughter.|
12924|"Heh heh heh¡KIs Grandee Sopolon still in his city of Kiel?" The confused evil skeleton asks between bouts of laughter.|

12926|"Heh heh heh¡KI hear that the present housekeeper of the Small Island is an elf called Tiptop, yes?"  The confused evil skeleton asks between bouts of laughter.|
12927|"Heh¡K Is Raytus the father of the Super Battle Master?" The confused evil skeleton asks between bouts of laughter.|
12928|"You've ended my confusion!" The Confused Missing Body passes a strong energy into your body. Use this power to defeat the Confused Evil Skeleton!|
12929|"No!"\ You've told me a wrong answer.. and now you'll pay! The Confused Missing Body forces a mysterious angry power into your body.|
12930|You have shown unprecedented courage and gained the protection of the Elf Jellies in defeating the Confused Evil Skeleton. Head for the upper levels to take down the remaining evil spirits.|
12931|The Evil Phantom Lord has filled the Midight Blue Phantom Ship with evil spirits appears! Go to the cabins on the upper level to find the malevolent crystal with the same color as the Evil Phantom Lord. Break it to claim the power of the Evil Lord!|
12932|"I'm late. Thank you, elf envoy. Come to the upper deck of the Midnight Blue Phantom Ship to find me!" As the Evil Phantom Lord falls, Kumey's voice begins to call out from the upper levels of the cabin.|
12933|The Evil Phantom Lord summons a special power that surrounds him with green dust. Break the green phantom crystal quickly!|
12934|The Phantom Evil Lord howls wildly, emitting a bright yellow light. Quick, destroy the yellow phantom crystal!|
12935|The Evil Phantom Lord quickly beats on his. A gust of bloody air begins to spread about. Hurry and break the red phantom crystal!|
12936|A fear deep inside your heart makes you unable to return to the upper levels of the Midnight Blue Phantom Ship to fight the evil spirits.|
12937|"Whooo, whooo¡KIt's so boring in the middle of the night. Who wants to sing and dance with me!?" These owls are getting noisy - and a lot more start appearing before your very eyes! End this out-of-tune nightmare!|
12938|Lovely spongy jelly rabbits¡K and every last one looks so yummy? Look carefully, it seems like there are a few special types among this white ocean of jelly rabbits.|
12939|"The weather is so nice today! I will trim my favorite parterre." Meowber King says happily. It sounds like you'll have to fight him in order to reclaim the garden! |
12940|The Beastman King is held up by his beastman soldiers, seemingly unable  o move. But don't let  your guard down, be careful in this trial refining!|
12941|Why does this jelly rabbit look a bit fat!? Want to take it home as a pet so much? It's not right! We need to face this trial refining quickly!|
12942|Don't hurry. Slow down and follow the rules. Don't run around!|
12943|It looks like you've gone off in the wrong direction! Hurry, choose your blessing of the gods and accept the trial refining!|

12993|The Dessert Maze smells of freshly baked, rich chocolate cake. The scent wafts through the air; hunger begins to gnaw at your strength.|
12994|You have stepped into the sealed spirit zone. The power to convert souls into cake begins coursing through your body!|
12995|<Black Sheep Cult> Underground Master Chef has sent Snack Predators to stop the Sprite Messengers. You must defeat these pests immediately!|

12997|More Snack Predators have appeared. Time for a food fight - defeat them now!|
12998|Even more Snack Predators have shown up. You must slay them if you want to survive!|
12999|The evil cuisine of the Underground Master Chef transformed the Snack Predators' rage and hate into a horde of wraiths...|
13000|Wraiths are pouring out of the spirit zone! Destroy them, or they will eat you alive! You probably taste like chicken!|
13001|Even more wraiths keep skittering closer. If you don't defeat them soon, the barrier will not come down!|
13002|Go, my pretties. Eat these blasted Sprite Messengers alive! the Underground Master Chef cackled as he summoned a Gluttonous Drake.|
13003|You'll make the perfect dessert for my Gluttonous Drake. Your pride is the cherry on top! roared the Underground Master Chef.|
13004|You blasted fool! How could you eat my Gluttonous Drake?! His flesh tastes like headcheese and garbage! bemoaned the Underground Master Chef.|
13005|The Gluttonous Drake will destroy everything it sees! Keep clear of this terrible power!|
13006|There are now enough wraiths to break through the barrier. Teleport into the spirit zone to destroy all of the wraiths now!|
13007|The power of the wraiths broke through the barrier. The resulting explosion destroyed a great number of wraiths. Seize the opportunity to slay the Underground Master Chef!|
13008|With his dying breath, the Underground Master Chef unleashed an incredibly powerful demon in the Dessert Maze!|
13009|The Magic Mushroom Jelly Rabbit's body fades away. The Black Sheep Cult's sinister schemes have been thwarted once more!|
13010|For Saphael! cried the Dessert Guardian, charging in bravely.|
13011|The Mysterious Youth and Dessert Guardian have appeared in the spirit zone. Talk to the Mysterious Youth, then head back and beat the frosting off the Snack Predators!|
13012|More Snack Predators have turned into wraiths. Quick, defeat them!|
13013|More Snack Predators have turned into wraiths. Quick, defeat them!|
13014|The mysterious radiation of the Black Sheep Crystal hangs heavy in the air. You feel weak and limp...|
13015|The mecha army in the Glimmershine Valley is attacking! Use summoning magic to protect the Bleating Sheep!|
13016|The Summoning Station in the distance is likely the source of the mecha army's power. Destroy it now!|
13017|Another Summoning Station has come online deep within the valley. Keep going; you must demolish it!|
13018|The mecha army's pressing forward! Find the Summoning Station!|
13019|Only one more Summoning Station is left. Destroy it to reveal the mastermind!|
13020|Who are you? I had lunch plans! grumbled a booming voice that echoed through the valley.|

13058|A terrible pressure pushes against you as an icy cold continues to seep through the door and into the room. The Captain's Sealing Power seems to have grown much stronger!|
13059|You return to the first room. The Captain's curse doesn't seem to have been weakened at all.|

13066|A weakened Kuda appears next to Walgo and Moghama's bodies. His eyes, though bloodshot, are filled with murderous intent.|
13067|Please, hurry. I don't think I can take it any more... Kuda manages, pain in his eyes.|
13068|Well done, Sprite Messenger. The evil energy has disappeared completely. Come find me at the entrance to the ruins. Kuma's voice resonates through the ruins.|
13069|A mysterious light spot appears in an open expanse, and you hear a faint voice calling out to you.|
13070|The Sprite King's agents and Treasure Seekers have formed a treasure hunting party to explore the Ancient Sprite King's Hoard. Join Kuda and his merry companions to discover the secret of the ancient treasure!|

13072|The power that locked away the inheritance of the ancient Sprite King has been lifted! A giant treasure chest appears, but it has absorbed so much evil energy over the years that it has mutated into a monster! Help Kuda and his companions defeat the Big Treasure Monster.|

13083|The effects of the collapsed bindings prove too much for the Investigative Report. It glows blue, then shatters to pieces before disappearing altogether. Your quest has failed.|
13084|Why is there a runaway Sprite idiot here? Why did you allow this to happen, Sprite Messenger? You disappoint me... The voice of Sprite King Siropas echoes through the ruins. You've royally screwed up this time.|

13216|Ronto, Duke of Sands: It's been quite some time since I've seen such an outstanding Sprite Messenger. I didn't expect you to successfully challenge my illusion.

13257|Battlefield Background 
On the eve of the Day of Destiny, the Kaslow Army came across a deserted island in the south sea. On the island is a strange Forest Crystal that harbors great power. 
The Kaslow Army plans to host practice battles using the power of the Forest Crystal as a way to boost the strength of the Sprite Messengers. Thus, troops have been stationed on the island for Sprite Messengers to challenge. 
The Kaslow Army encourages Sprite Messengers to utilize the power of the Forest Crystal. Sprite Messengers who acquire said power will receive a handsome reward. Competing for this reward - and the crystal's immense power - has caused an unexpected battle to break out among Sprite Messengers from around the world.

*Rules 
(1) Players are divided into Blue and Red camps. Each camp begins with 300 points. The first side to lose all points suffers defeat!
(2) Players can attack and capture the Forest Crystal on the battlefield. When the crystal changes to your side's color, the enemy camp loses 1 point every 10 seconds. 
(3) Players with crystals must defend the crystal while the other players try to capture it. The attacking and defending side switch when the color of the crystal changes after being attacked. 
(4) 1 point is awarded for every player defeated. 
(5) The enemy camp loses 50 points for each enemy defensive tower on the frontline destroyed. Destroying the defensive tower in the enemy's main camp yields immediate victory. 
(6) Once the battle starts, the pioneer generals from each side will battle each other at the center of the map. The enemy camp loses 50 points if their general is defeated. Our side will also receive powerful reinforcements after 30 seconds. 
(7) The enemy camp loses 50 points if the general of their main camp is defeated. 
(8) Sprite Messengers do not have the power to damage towers and generals on the battlefield directly. They must rely on their side's soldiers or Tank Transformation. 
(9) Defeat enemy soldiers on the battlefield for a chance to receive a Battlefield Supply Chest or PVP Kill Reward. 10 Battlefield Supply Chests can be traded to the Tank Craftsman for Tank Transformation status. PVP Kill Reward is a stackable buff. 
(10) At the end of the battle, the system will award scores based on performance. The player with the highest score on the winning side will be the Battlefield MVP. 
(11) Players will need the points obtained on the battlefield to collect the Sprite King's secret treasures. The riches are yours for the taking!|

They say that the youngest of the Sprite Royals she has remained asleep ever since she was born. 

Her tranquil face fills onlookers with peace as she dreams of harmony and a land without sorrow. 

In the ancient Sprite language, Ginny means "Hope." The translucent crystal ball she holds in her hands shows people the way to paradise. 

Legend has it she brings hope and vitality. Barren land turns to fertile soil as she slumbers, crops grow, and spring water flows, all for this beautiful, sleeping princess, her long lashes occasionally fluttering just slightly as she dreams. 

Ginny did not take part in the Sprite King War that occurred thousands of years ago; she was fast asleep. She will only wake when she is needed most.|

13394|Battlefield Background
On the eve of the Day of Destiny, Sprites in Saphael found a new crystal in the mouth of Hell of Fire, a volcano in the Blakatoa Range. The Sprites fear the threat of nearby monsters and hope Sprite Messengers can retrieve the gem before beasts get ahold of it.
The Sprite King has promised great rewards to Sprite Messengers who can bring the crystal's energies back. This causes an unexpected battle to break out among Sprite Messengers from around the world over the crystal. 
Sprite Messengers have discovered a way to borrow the power of the rare dragons that lurk in the Hellfire Battlefield. Both sides now seek to harness the Fire Dragon Power, as well. 
Rules 
(1) Players are divided into Blue and Red factions to attack the New Life Crystal on the field. When the crystal turns the color of one side, that side will receive 1 point every 5 sec. 
(2) The side that possesses the gem must defend it, while the other side must try to capture it. After it is attacked, the crystal changes color, and the offense and defense switch. 
(3) 1 point is awarded for every player defeated. 
(4) When the score difference reaches 35, the system will randomly pick a player from the losing side and transform the player into a Flying Dragon. Each side can only transform once per battle. 
(5) When the Dragon Queen at the volcano peak is defeated, a dragon egg will appear in the dragon roost. The player that smashes the dragon egg will receive the ability to transform into a Fire Dragon. The dragon egg respawns every 20 seconds. 
(6) The dragon whelps near each side's respawn points can be defeated by player-transformed Fire Dragons using the skill Consuming Flame. 10 points is awarded for each enemy dragon whelp defeated. Dragon whelps respawn every 20 seconds. 
(7) Once 20 dragon eggs have been smashed, the Fire Dragon King will descend from the mountain peak and start killing anyone it sees on the battlefield. 
(8) If both sides defeat the Fire Dragon King together, the Ancient Dragon Soul will appear at each side's respawn point. Players can freely collect the power to transform into Fire Dragons from the Dragon Soul, then use this newfound power to attack enemy players and dragon whelps. 
(9) The first side to reach 250 points, or the side with a higher score after 20 minutes, wins. 
(10) At the end of the battle, the system will award scores based on performance. The player with the highest score on the winning side will become the Battlefield MVP. 
(11) Players will need the points obtained on the battlefield to collect the Sprite King's secret treasures. Work your hardest if you wish to reap the rewards of battle!|
13395|Your Sprite has lost the Champion Boxer title.|
13396|Unfortunately, your Sprite was defeated in the current Boxing Championship. Perhaps it floated less like a butterfly, more like a rhino. Here's your participation prize for the current Boxing Championship!|

14971|After the behemoth has been defeated, several lines of enchanted script appear. They seem to refer to a particular location.|

15055|"Battlefield Background"
To even have a glimmer of hope to survive the Day of Destiny and save Saphael,
the Sprite Messengers must hone their skills, whet their blades, and sharpen their minds.
Recognizing the imminent danger, the Sprite Kings have thus developed the ideal battleground for Sprite Messengers
who wish to become exemplary fighters
and uphold their duty to the lands. Its name is Werewolf Village.
"Rules"
(1) After entering the battleground, you'll have an approximately 1 minute of prep time.
            During this time, you may not move or use any items.
            Once the prep time is over, players will be allowed to move and attack freely.
            However, normal attack damage has been drastically reduced. Items are still not allowed.
(2) The battlefield lasts up to 20 minutes. The team that reaches 250 pts
            will win.
(3) The blue team needs to use the "Versatile Hand" to attack
            the "Energy Cache" in order to acquire abilities that can attack red team players.
            The red team needs to use the "Bite" skill to attack
            blue team players.
(4) Two instructor NPCs will spawn in the battlefield at (166, 139)
            and (361, 826). Players can speak with them to learn
            the detailed rules of the battlefield.
(5) There are even more tips and tricks just waiting for players to discover!|

15279|"Battlefield Background"
The Sprite Kings are enthusiastic about all the progress
that Sprite Messengers have made. They're worried, however, that one day a powerful enemy
will arise that will be too powerful for any single Sprite Messenger.
They're also worried that Sprite Messengers will be too proud to ask for help defeating the menace. Recognizing the imminent danger, the Sprite Kings have thus
asked the elders of the Fox Tribe to organize the Fox Training Ground.
There, Sprite Messengers can strive to realize their true potential
as long as they're willing to work as a team.

"Rules"
(1) Players are divided into Red and Blue Teams.
(2) Talk to <Fox Elder> Hugo to obtain one of the four following skills sets:
            "Melee Brawler", "Mid-Range Shooter", "Distance Caster", or
           "Support Combatant".
(3) To change your role, talk with Hugo again.
            
(4) Form your team properly and work together to defeat the enemy.
(5) 1 point is awarded for every player defeated.
(6) The first side to reach 250 points, or the side
with a higher score after 20 minutes, wins. At the end of the battle, the system will award
scores based on performance.
(7) Players will need the points obtained on the battlefield to collect the Sprite Kings' secret treasures.
Get ready for the fight of your life!|
15280|Hugo: Welcome to the Fox Training Ground. Choose a battlefield role from me before you enter the battleground.|
15281|Hugo: Situations change quickly on the battlefield. If you want to switch to another role, just talk to me again.|
15282|Hugo: Each role has its strengths and weaknesses. Make sure to choose the correct roles for your team.|
15283|Hugo: Use teamwork to achieve victory!|
15284|Quill, Hurricane Prince: "Your future is filled with hardship and sorrow.
You have proved yourself by defeating my avatar.
Perhaps there's still hope for you yet. Now go! I hope you understand the gravity
of the path you've chosen."|
15285|Mosunk, Elder of Serenity: "Haha! It's always a pleasure
to talk with you energetic Sprite Messengers. You have passed the trial of the Endless Cycle.
I believe the experience you've gained here
will play a pivotal role in your future."|
15286|Jundo, Eternal Mother: "My child, it's such a relief to see
you growing into the hero I knew you could be.
I hope when the Day of Destiny comes, you and other Sprite Messengers will be able to work together
to overcome all obstacles.|

15405|Lucile: "I remember that day well. My elder sister and I went to Snow Forest for a stroll. I caught a glimpse of my favorite Snow Yggdrasil Tree."|
15406|Lucile: "We enjoyed a leisurely afternoon in the shade of that ancient tree. Unfortunately, we had no idea our happy times were about to come to a devastating end."|
15407|Lucile: "The emerald leaves turned onyx black. The tree I once loved drained the lives of the good people of Delore."|
15408|Lucile: "When the ancient tree finally ceased draining energy and life from its surroundings, pure chaos broke out. Now, though, I am finally free."|
15409|Cyprus: Despite our best efforts, this giant tree remains unshaken. Its magic, however, is slowly fading. It can no longer cause harm."|

15414|Cyprus: "That Shaga Shaga is really one in a million, don't you think? Don't tell me you're already struggling!"|
15415|Cyprus: "Don't be discouraged. Shaga Shaga is incredibly powerful. I mean, he even injured me once! Me! Can you imagine? It was just a scratch, but still. He's no easy opponent."|
15416|Cyprus: "I'm trembling with excitement. I can't wait to go to battle with you!" Hahaha!"|
15417|Missing Investigator "Here! We're over here (621, 625)!" Please! Help us! We'll be in the clear once we get to (555, 458), just hang on!"|

15419|Gegaga: "You... were sent by Cyprus? My people repented long ago. Please, leave my people alone!"|
15420|Gegaga: "Ah, you poor, gullible fool, that was merely a ruse! I had you going there, didn't I? I'm clearly the strongest. Cyprus has nothing on me!" Don't you dare think of casting my people aside!"|
15421|Giant Barbarian: "Curses! How dare you slay my dear brothers? I shall avenge them! I'm coming, big brother!"|
15422|Cyprus: "Not too shabby. You actually stood your ground. You're getting stronger by the day. I'll wait for you in the next level!"|

15443|Cyprus: "Those creatures and the mutated ancient trees... I mean, I can handle them alone, but fighting with your team was truly wonderful."|
15444|The ancient trees in the Snow Forest constantly drain the life and energy of their surroundings...|
15445|Cyprus: "If fate allows, I shall see you in battle again someday."|

15453|Phoebios: "Third question! Who has trained with the Templar? Defeat him!"|
15454|Phoebios: "Come! You can pass now!"|
15455|Cyprus: "Let's go, Phoebios! Let them witness our powers!"|
15456|Cyprus: "Phoebios! Give me 5 seconds! I'll use my Ultimate Defense Power!"|

15688|Beldargoth: "Ha ha ha, how do you justify killing those Sprites, Sprite Messengers? Just look how pathetic you are! Feel the pain and despair!"|
15689|Beldargoth: "NO! This is not possible! How come you haven't killed any Sprites?! Humans are selfish, ruthless and unscrupulous! You can't fool me!"|

16442|Favorite name has been confirmed|
16443|Smother: "Horrible, terrifying...I don't want to be here anymore!"|
16444|The Goblin Swordsmith's sleeves are filthy. With a wave of his sleeves, he drops a piece of paper.|
16445|The Cruel Goblin Butcher drops a bag. It should be his lunch leftover.|
16446|This food is coated with thick motor oil. Despite its translucent look, the sticky feel it gives when touching it is quite disgusting.|
16447|With the strong wind keeping blowing, that sticky oil gradually solidifies.|
16448|Buzz buzz buzz! You hear electricity leaking from some machine nearby.|
16449|After seeing a sudden flash of light right in front of you, you return to the place where you first came to this world...|
16450|Saul: Why is it so noisy outside?|
16451|You feel a sharp look and raise your hands immediately.|
16452|We finally came in after so many hardships.|
16453|There's a commotion at the entrance of the Corpse Cave! Watch out!|
16454|Shout: I just saw a Jelly Rabbit coming out of the Corpse Cave in the Corrosive Worm Lair and eating a bunch of disgusting bugs!|
16455|Chara: What?!!|
16456|Anthorra: How is that possible?!!|
16457|Noll: Cough, cough, cough!!|
16458|Zindel: Cool!!|
16459|Aendello: Ahhhhhh!!|
16460|The face of the Magma Giant is perfectly printed on the T-Shirt. You smile a satisfying smile when you see such a perfect trendy T-shirt.|
16461|Suddenly there's a huge thing coming towards you - it turns out to be a Jelly Rabbit!|
16462|Proceed to the next patrol point.|
16463|Carso's Thief: "You found me!"|
16464|Hakan: "These bad guys are just so so! Thank you, Sprite Messenger. I'm returning to the village."|
16465|Jelly Rabbits appear on the bridge! Quickly count how many there are.|

16471|Tick... Tick... You hear some faint clockwork sound.|
16472|Adami: "Huh? Who's here and where am I......I don't know why I'm so tired. Let me take a nap!"|
16473|As you turn around, you notice that several ferocious Beastmen are staring at you......|
16474|Smother: "Boohoo...It's terrifying...But I'm numb...Please take me to (280, 505) and leave this place!"|
16475|Shuu: "Escort Elendin to (318, 214) to gather!"|
16476|Elendin: "Whew, it's finally here. I'm so tired...I'm going to bed...No! I'm going to collect. I'll leave my back to you!"|
16477|The challenge begins. The questions are inside the box. Go open it.|

16492|The Mine has been removed.|
16493|You stepped on the ground Mine and were blown to powder. Challenge failed.|
16494|The wolves approach Elendin and roar furiously. It seems to be calling for some terrible creature...|

16499|Peninsula Beauty Room: "Friends of the Sorrow Peninsula! We're from Inner Mountain Continent!"|
16500|You can see that the shallow water is filled with jewels, photo frames, long-soaked letters, and so on. They must have been left behind by those who have been hurt by love. Is it really all right to leave them here? You can't help thinking that.|
16501|"A robot assembled with the recycled parts is out of control and attacking you!"|
16502|Submarine Operator: "Hey! Sprite Messenger! You've been diving for too many times!"|
16503|You found that the robot behind you has broken. It looks like there's still a long way to go before it can become a very strong Mecha Soldier......|
16504|You carefully place the rusty sword of the Myriglia Brigade Commander in front of the grave to pay your tribute to the Eternal Leader.|
16505|"Well? There seems to be a strange statue model!?|
16506|You're pulled onto the bridge and realize that your Backpack has been stuffed with something.|
16507|Upon hearing the commotion, you stop... The Sunbird Knight who keeps zigzagging nearly runs into you and drops something into your hands.|
16508|You must have bought your rider's license with a chicken leg!?|
16509|You drink up the potion and think of that Sprite's condition, which makes you feel like crying...|
16510|Although Cyloter is so scared that he becomes pale and starts to scream, he still doesn't want to escape the light house!|
16511|Sitting alone in a corner of the sea and looking at the beautiful distant scenery make you want to stay here for a while.|
16512|After reading this heart-shaped card, you firmly believe that Browney must be an angel!|
16513|Even though it feels a bit absurd to be suddenly pulled onto the bridge, reading this card does make you feel much better.|
16514|The Sunbird Knight who keeps zigzagging nearly runs into you, drops something and speeds away......|
16515|Scanning into the distance on the edge of the cliff, a lonely feeling emerges spontaneously. It turns out that this is the feeling of being all alone in this big world...|
16516|Splash! Minton behind you steps on the Trap set by Lana and elegantly falls into the water with a loud scream.|
16517|You decide to tear up this photo and feel both righteous and kind again!|
16518|With a flash of light, you see that Ters and Bolai have both their bodies back. That was so close!|
16519|This is so delicious! You don't feel irritated anymore!|
16520|Some party member is in a different channel, Battlefield or Dungeons from that of the party leader, so the party leader cannot roll the dice.|
